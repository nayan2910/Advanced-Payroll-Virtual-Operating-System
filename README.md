Copy these files into local folder Name it as "Payroll Management System"
and then Copy all documents to your folder.
Then there are 5 databases stored in "column" folder and then Set 5 System DNS names as:

DNS Name                Address
NayanDesale ->  give it's address to EmployeeDetails.mdb database
Dept        ->  give it's address to Dept.mdb database
Incentives  ->  give it's address to Incentives.mdb database
Leave       ->  give it's address to LeaveEntry.mdb database
Password    ->  give it's address to Password.mdb database

After that use Java 1.6 because 1.7 doesnt support system DNS, we need external jar file for that.
Finally run :
dont compile it if you have java 1.7 because it will overrite the java 1.6 class files because I am adding the class files in the program
>java MainProject

Then it will virtual OS will load and will ask you for username and password which are both 'nayan'
uname: nayan
pass : nayan

then you will see the same environment as ubuntu (except for the start button)
